Ingredients:

** 600 g fresh tuna steak,from sustainable sources, ask your fishmonger
** 1 sprig of fresh basil
** 1 sprig of fresh mint
** 4 spring onions
** 1 pinch ground coriander
** 1 small lemon, zest and juice of
** 1 fresh red chilli, finely chopped
** olive oil
** sea salt
** freshly ground black pepper
** 1 handful round lettuce, leaves separated, washed and dried
** 1 handful rocket leaves, washed and dried
** 2 tomatoes, washed and sliced
** 4 ciabatta or hamburger buns
** 1 lemon, cut into wedges, to serve
** tomato ketchup, to serve


Method:

Whiz the tuna, basil, mint, spring onions, coriander and lemon zest and red chilli, if using,
together in a food processor or, alternatively, chop them all up together finely with a big
chopping knife. Tip the mixture out on to a clean work surface and divide into four equal
pieces.

Wet your hands (so the tuna won't stick to them) and shape the lumps of tuna – first into
balls, then into burgers by patting them down with the palm of your hand. Chill the burgers
for at least half an hour to let them set.

Heat a barbecue or griddle pan until hot. Brush the burgers on each side with a little oil and
season with a little salt and pepper. Grill for 2 minutes on each side or until cooked through
– the cooking will depend on how thick you made your burgers. It's OK to eat them when
they're still a little pink inside, but if you want to cook them through then go ahead.

Toast your buns lightly on the hot griddle pan or barbecue and make the burgers by filling
each bun with a hot tuna pattie, some dressed salad leaves, some sliced tomato, a wedge of
lemon on the side and some ketchup.

Tip: Make sure your barbecue or griddle pan is nice and hot before you cook the burgers!
